The goal of this project is to analyze SpaceX launch records, visualize trends, and build a machine learning model to predict the success of future launches.

Objectives:
-Collect SpaceX launch data using SpaceX APIs and Wikipedia scraping
-Clean and wrangle the dataset into a usable format
-Analyze trends using pandas and SQL
-Visualize insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
-Create an interactive dashboard using Dash and JupyterDash
-Build and tune machine learning models to predict launch success

Data sources:
-SpaceX REST API
-Wikipedia: Falcon 9 and Heavy Launches
-IBM Cloud Object Storage
